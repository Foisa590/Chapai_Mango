---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local)

```bash
# 1. Install deps
npm install

# 2. Copy env example
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# (you can leave Supabase keys blank for now — site uses mock data)

# 3. Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

---

## 🗄️ Supabase Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create a project
1. Go to <https://supabase.com> → **New project**
2. Name it `chapai-mango`, pick a region (Singapore is closest to BD)
3. Save the password somewhere safe

### 2. Run the schema
1. Open **SQL Editor** in Supabase dashboard
2. Click **New query**
3. Copy contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql) and **Run**
4. ✅ Tables created + RLS enabled + 6 mangoes + 3 testimonials seeded

### 3. Grab API keys
1. **Settings → API** in Supabase
2. Copy `Project URL` and `anon public` key
3. Paste into `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi...
```

Restart `npm run dev` — the site will now read from Supabase.

---

## 💳 Payment Setup (bKash / Nagad / Rocket)

This site uses a **manual MFS flow** (no SSL Commerz / merchant integration needed):

1. Customer chooses bKash / Nagad / Rocket on checkout
2. Site shows **your personal/agent number** + total amount
3. Customer "Send Money" → enters **TrxID + sender number** in form
4. Order saved to Supabase with `status='pending'`
5. You verify the transaction in your bKash app, then update `status='confirmed'` from Supabase dashboard

### Configure your numbers

Edit `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BKASH_NUMBER=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_NAGAD_NUMBER=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROCKET_NUMBER=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_PHONE=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_EMAIL=hello@chapaimango.com
```

> 💡 Pore SSLCommerz / Stripe-er proper integration korte chaile, just `components/checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx`-er `onSubmit` handler change korle hobe.

---

## 📦 Manage Orders

Open Supabase → **Table Editor → `orders`**:

- `status='pending'` → new order, payment unverified
- Verify TrxID in bKash/Nagad/Rocket app
- Update to `confirmed` → `shipped` → `delivered`

You can also build an admin panel later at `/admin` (Supabase auth + service role).

---

## 🚂 Deploy to Railway (recommended, 5 minutes)

Railway uses **Nixpacks** to detect Next.js automatically. Config files in this repo (`railway.json`, `nixpacks.toml`) make the build deterministic and add a healthcheck.

### 1. Sign in
1. Go to <https://railway.com> → **Login**
2. **Continue with GitHub** → authorize

### 2. Create the project
1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
2. Select **`Foisa590/Chapai_Mango`**
3. Railway detects Next.js + reads `railway.json` → starts an initial build
4. **Wait** — first build takes ~3-4 minutes (you'll see logs streaming)

### 3. Add environment variables
1. Open the service → **Variables** tab
2. Add each one (use the **Raw Editor** for bulk paste):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi...
NEXT_PUBLIC_BKASH_NUMBER=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_NAGAD_NUMBER=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROCKET_NUMBER=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_PHONE=01XXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_EMAIL=hello@chapaimango.com
```

3. Save — Railway will auto-redeploy with the new variables

### 4. Generate a public URL
1. **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain**
2. Railway gives you `chapai-mango-production.up.railway.app` (or similar)
3. Open it → 🎉 your site is live

### 5. (Optional) Custom domain
1. **Settings → Networking → Custom Domain** → add `chapaimango.com`
2. Add the CNAME / A record Railway shows you in your DNS provider
3. Wait ~10 minutes — Railway provisions HTTPS automatically

### Health check
Railway pings `/api/health` every few seconds to confirm the app is alive. Endpoint defined in `app/api/health/route.ts` — always returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

> 💰 **Pricing note:** Railway gives a one-time **$5 trial credit** (no card needed) — enough to run this site for ~1 month while testing. After that, the **Hobby plan ($5/month, ~৳600)** is required and needs a card. If you want a permanently-free option, use Vercel instead (see below).

---

### 1. Push to GitHub
This repo is already at <https://github.com/Foisa590/Chapai_Mango>. Just commit & push your local changes.

## 🛠️ Admin Dashboard

A full admin dashboard ships at **`/admin`** — protected by Supabase Auth.

### Features

| Section | URL | What you can do |
|---|---|---|
| Login | `/admin/login` | Email + password sign-in |
| Dashboard | `/admin` | Total orders, pending count, revenue, products, recent orders, quick actions |
| Orders | `/admin/orders` | Filter by status tabs (pending / confirmed / shipped / delivered / cancelled), table view |
| Order detail | `/admin/orders/[id]` | View customer info, items, payment + TrxID, change status, delete |
| Products | `/admin/products` | Card grid with image + price + stock, Edit, Delete |
| New product | `/admin/products/new` | Add a new mango variety (multi-image, featured toggle) |
| Edit product | `/admin/products/[id]/edit` | Update existing product |
| Messages | `/admin/messages` | Read contact-form submissions, click-to-reply via email/phone, delete |

The admin area uses its own sidebar layout (no public navbar) and is fully responsive — mobile sidebar opens via hamburger.

### Create your admin user

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication → Users → Add user**
2. Choose **Create new user**
3. Email: `admin@chapaimango.com` (or whatever)
4. Password: a strong password
5. ✅ Check **Auto Confirm User**
6. Click **Create user**

> Need more than one admin? Just add more users the same way — anyone authenticated has admin access. RLS policies in `supabase/schema.sql` allow any authenticated user to manage everything.

### Re-running schema.sql for admin RLS

If you set up Supabase before this admin update, re-run [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql) (it's idempotent — `drop policy if exists` + `create policy`). The bottom block adds the admin policies that authorize logged-in users to update/delete orders, manage products, etc.

### Migrating existing seeded products to Bengali

The seed in `schema.sql` uses `ON CONFLICT (slug) DO NOTHING`, so re-running it does **not** translate already-inserted English rows. If your Supabase project still shows English product names like "Premium Himsagar" instead of "প্রিমিয়াম হিমসাগর", run the migration once:

1. Open Supabase **SQL Editor → New query**
2. Paste the contents of [`supabase/migrate-bangla.sql`](./supabase/migrate-bangla.sql)
3. Click **Run** — products + testimonials are translated, origin updated to Nijampur, Nachole

The script is safe to run multiple times.

### Sign in

1. Run the dev server (`npm run dev`)
2. Visit <http://localhost:3000/admin>
3. Middleware redirects you to `/admin/login`
4. Sign in with the email + password you created in Supabase
5. You'll land on the dashboard

---

## 👤 Customer Auth + Order History

Customers must now **sign up / sign in** before they can place an order, and they get a personal **order history page** at `/orders`.

### Pages

| URL | What |
|---|---|
| `/signup` | Create a customer account (full name, phone, email, password) |
| `/login` | Sign in with email + password (auto-redirects to `/orders` or `?next=`) |
| `/orders` | The signed-in customer's personal order history |

The navbar shows a **circular initial avatar** when signed in. Tapping it opens a menu with:
- আমার অর্ডার (My Orders)
- অ্যাডমিন প্যানেল (only visible if the user's email is in `admin_emails`)
- সাইন আউট (Sign out)

### Run the customer-auth migration (one-time)

1. **Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → + New query**
2. Paste the contents of [`supabase/customer-auth.sql`](./supabase/customer-auth.sql) and **Run**.
3. **Add your admin email** (without this, `/admin/*` will reject every login):

```sql
insert into public.admin_emails (email)
values ('your-admin@email.com')   -- ⬅️ replace with your real admin email
on conflict do nothing;
```

The script:
- Adds a `user_id` column to `orders` linking each order to a Supabase Auth user
- Creates an `admin_emails` whitelist + `is_admin()` helper function
- Replaces the old "anyone can insert" policies with auth-required policies:
  - **Customer:** can insert and read **only their own** orders
  - **Admin (whitelisted email):** full read/update/delete access
- Tightens `contact_messages`: anyone can submit, only admin can read/manage

### How the flow now works

1. Customer hits **Checkout** → middleware redirects to `/login` if not signed in
2. Customer signs up at `/signup` (or signs in) → returns to checkout
3. Order insert sets `user_id = auth.uid()` so it ties to the customer
4. After "অর্ডার কনফার্ম!" the customer can visit `/orders` to see history
5. Admin still uses `/admin/login` and lands at `/admin` for the dashboard

### Disabling email confirmation (recommended for low-friction signup)

By default Supabase requires email confirmation before a new user can sign in. To let customers order immediately after signup:

1. Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication → Providers → Email**
2. Turn **off** "Confirm email"
3. Save

(If you want to keep confirmation on for security, the signup form already shows a "check your inbox" message instead of redirecting.)
